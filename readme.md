#Command Weather

A small pointless for grabbing the current weather from whatever location you want. Simply type `node app.js a` + the location of your choosing. Trying to wrap my head around the world of javascript's asyncness.

app-promise.js is the async implementation of app.js

That's all it does, dats it!
